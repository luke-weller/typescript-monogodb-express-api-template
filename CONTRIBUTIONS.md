Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Typescript Mongodb Express.JS API Template! We welcome contributions from the community to help improve our project. Please take a moment to review the guidelines below before getting started.

We are always looking for ways to improve and make it easier for developers to get started with our API template. We want to provide a seamless experience for editing and building great things.

## Branching Strategy

To contribute, we follow a branching strategy that promotes collaboration and ensures a smooth merge process. Here's an overview of our branching strategy:

1. **Main Branch**: The `main` branch is the production-ready branch that always reflects the latest stable release of the project.

2. **Feature Branches**: When working on a new feature or bug fix, create a new branch off the `main` branch. Name the branch descriptively, using kebab-case or snake_case.

3. **Pull Requests**: Once you have completed your work on a feature branch, open a pull request (PR) to merge your changes into the `main` branch. Make sure to provide a clear and concise description of the changes made.

4. **Code Review**: Other contributors will review your PR and provide feedback. Address any feedback or comments and make necessary changes to your code.

5. **Merge**: Once your PR has been approved and all checks pass, it will be merged into the `main` branch. Please do not merge your own PRs.
